# AllTech

AllTech is an e-commerce website where users can search, view and purchase smartphones. To add products to the cart, the user must create an account, validate and log in. After logging in, the user will be able to add or remove items from the cart and confirm the purchase. The user is asked for a delivery address and a payment method and if everything is correct the order is accepted.

This is a mock-up project made exclusively with the aim of developing my skills as a web developer and learning the details of a fullstack application. Currently, payments are handled by a simulated PayPal account. This code can be used for real ecommerce along with a real payment API like stripe, but some adjustments will be needed.
